# Demo on Android Studio

The most convenient method for executing the demo application is to launch it within Android Studio. If you have already installed Android Studio, please proceed with the following simple instructions:

#### Step 1:

On Android Studio, navigate to the **File** menu and select the **Open** option. Subsequently, locate and select the extracted UI kit’s `focus_flutter_ui_kit` folder.

#### Step 2

Locate the `focus_flutter_ui_kit/pubspec.yaml` file and click on the "**Pub get**" button. This action will fetch all the Flutter dependencies that the UI kit necessitates.

#### Step 3:

Locate the target device on the top bar and click the “**Run**” button.
