# Requirements

The Focus Flutter UI Kit requires nothing more than the the Flutter SDK and most commonly available development environment and favorite IDEs (Google's Android Studio preferred).

### Required Knowledge

To effectively utilize the UI kit, a fundamental understanding of Dart or Flutter is necessary. A comprehensive grasp of`Widget` (Stateless and Stateful), `Container`, `Column`, `Row`, and `SizedBox` is sufficient knowledge to effectively utilize the UI kit.

The UI kit also incorporates Bloc, a library for state management, which facilitates the management of state within numerous UI widgets. Alternatively, utilizing other state management libraries is perfectly acceptable for your own development endeavors.

### Flutter SDK and Dart Version

The required versions:

* Flutter 3.x.
* Dart 3.x.
