# File Upload

Both the `FUIFileUploadDropbox` and the `FUIFileUploadItem` are merely aesthetic widgets that lack any functional capabilities for file uploading.

### File Uploading Demo and Code

The demo application includes a simulated file uploading functionality (which utilizes the [flutter\_dropzone](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dropzone) package). Please refer to the demo folder for further details.
